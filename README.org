This is an *unofficial* remake and has nothing to do with the original copy of the game. It has been developed as an example project to showcase the capabilities of the [[https://github.com/sparky-game/volt][Volt Game Engine]]; therefore, it's *purely educational* in nature and has *no commercial intent*.

ESCAPE! Your mind throbs, trapped in the *Room of Doom*, the fiendish gunmen are trying to annihilate you. Shots come from secret portholes that *mysteriously open and close*. Watch out! The gunmen have unleashed a hydra-headed monster; it relentlessly pursues you. Don't panic! Your marksmanship can stun it, but only for a moment. Should you remain in the Room of Doom too long, the monster becomes *invulnerable* to your bullets.

Dodge the gunmen's firepower; shoot them in return *when the secret portholes open* and then Escape ... But where? The next *Room of Doom* awaits. An even more diabolical chamber with rapid-fire gunmen and devious monsters trying to destroy you.

Can you survive the full gauntlet of Rooms and escape unscathed?
